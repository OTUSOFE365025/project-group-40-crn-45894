## Main Use Cases (FCAPS Style)

| Use Case ID & Name | Description | Related Requirements |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **UC-1: Query Academic Information** | Student asks questions about grades, deadlines, or exam dates using chat or voice. System interprets the query via AI, retrieves live data from LMS/Registration/Calendar [R1, R3, R5, R6], enforces SSO and per-user isolation [RS7, RS8], logs the interaction for personalization, and returns answers within â‰¤2s [RS10]. Fallback or clarification provided if data is missing [RS13]. | R1, R3, R5, R6, RS1, RS7, RS8, RS10, RS13 |
| **UC-2: Receive Notifications and Alerts** | Student receives notifications for deadlines, schedule changes, and announcements based on configured preferences [R1, R3]. Notifications are delivered via chat or voice, acknowledgment is recorded [RS2, RS6], and alerts are queued to meet performance targets [RS9, RS10]. | R1, R3, RS2, RS6, RS9, RS10 |
| **UC-3: Publish Course Materials and Announcements** | Lecturer issues commands to upload or update course content and release announcements [R1, R3, RL1, RL2]. System verifies authorization [RL8], synchronizes updates with LMS, and notifies students automatically. | R1, R3, RL1, RL2, RL8 |
| **UC-4: Track System Analytics** | Administrator requests dashboards to monitor usage, performance, and system health [RA4, RA6, RM2, RM4]. System retrieves logs and metrics, visualizes key indicators, and securely stores reports. | RA4, RA6, RM2, RM4 |
| **UC-5: Do Maintenance and Deployment** | System Maintainer triggers automated deployment pipelines to push updates [R7, RA6, RM1, RM2]. System authorizes actions, deploys new versions to the cloud, monitors uptime, latency, and errors, and logs metrics for review [RM6, RM7]. If deployment fails, rollback occurs and maintainer is notified. | R7, RA6, RM1, RM2, RM6, RM7 |
