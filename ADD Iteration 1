Include in this file the 7 steps for Iteration 1

This iteration decomposes the entire AIDAP system into major components/layers to satisfy the drivers from Deliverable 1.

Step 1:
Element name: AIDAP System (overall platform)

Responsibilities (from Deliverable 1):
AIDAP provides a conversational interface for students, lecturers, administrators, and maintainers to access, manage, and disseminate academic and administrative information. It must:

- Allow students to query academic info (exam dates, grades, deadlines, announcements) via chat/voice.

- Send proactive notifications and alerts (deadlines, schedule changes, announcements).

- - Let lecturers publish course materials and announcements, synced with LMS/registration.

- Provide administrators with system analytics (usage, performance, health).

- Support maintainers in deployment, monitoring, uptime, and zero-downtime updates.

Step 2: Architectural Drivers 

2.1: Primary Use Cases
    UC-1: Query Academic Information

        - Actor: Student

        - Goal: Ask questions about grades, deadlines, or exam dates via chat/voice; get accurate contextual answers.

        - Key steps:

            1. Student asks a question in chat/voice.

            2. AI interprets the query.

            3. System retrieves data from LMS/registration/database.

            4. Answer is shown with accurate context.

    UC-2: Receive Notifications and Alerts

        - Actor: Student

        - Goal: Receive deadline reminders, schedule changes, and announcements.

        - Key steps:

            1. System is triggered by new event/announcement.

            2. Assistant sends a notification (chat/voice).

            3 Student acknowledges/dismisses.

        - Related requirements: R1, R3, RS2, RS6, RS9, RS10

    UC-3: Publish Course Materials and Announcements

    Actor: Lecturer

        - Goal: Upload/update course content and issue announcements via AIDAP.

        - Key steps:

            1. Lecturer issues a command (e.g., “upload slides”, “post announcement”).

            2. System checks permissions and authorizes.

            3. Data is synchronized with LMS.

            4. Students are notified.

        - Related requirements: R1, R3, RL1, RL2, RL8

    UC-4: Track System Analytics

        Actor: Administrator

        Goal: View usage/performance/health analytics.

        Related requirements: RA4, RA6, RM2, RM4

    UC-5: Do Maintenance and Deployment

        Actor: System Maintainer

        Goal: Push updates and monitor uptime with rollback on failure.

        Related requirements: R7, RA6, RM1, RM2, RM6, RM7
