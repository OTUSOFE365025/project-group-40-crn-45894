# Quality Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Performance** | The system should respond to queries within 2 seconds on average under normal load (RS10). Notifications and AI responses should be processed quickly to ensure a smooth conversational experience. |
| **Availability** | The system must be available 99.5% of the time per month to meet institutional service expectations (RS11, RA6). Automatic failover and backup recovery mechanisms are required. |
| **Scalability** | The system should handle up to 5,000 concurrent users (RA7) and allow horizontal scaling in a cloud-native deployment (R7). |
| **Security** | User data must be protected and comply with institutional privacy policies (R8, RS7, RS8, RA5, RM7). Access control and authentication (SSO) are enforced. |
| **Usability** | The UI must be intuitive and consistent with conversational design best practices (RS12). Supports multiple languages (RS4) and device types (RS9). |
| **Maintainability** | System should allow maintainers to deploy updates with zero downtime (RM1), configure AI models and API keys (RM3), and monitor performance easily (RM2, RM4). |
| **Reliability** | The system must handle data source failures gracefully with retries or fallback responses (RD3, UC1 alternative flows) and ensure data integrity across integrated systems (RD4). |
| **Personalization** | The system should store historical interactions to improve response relevance and allow students to change preferences for notifications and language (R2, RS5, RS6). |
